    <h1>PIAIC Courses</h1>
    <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>The Ai program of the PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of AI technology, 
        via teaching programing in open source languages like Python, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow 2.0 
        and Flask, and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and ending with real-life
         example of modern day AI in practice.</p>
    <h2>Cloud Native Computing</h2>
    <p>
        The CNC program prepares the students to program in open source technologies like Linux, Docker,
        Kubernetes, JS, Node.JS, React Native while introducing students to development of Microservices
        and software development techniques on cloud platform like AWS.
    </p>
    <h2>BCC</h2>
    <p>
        The main emphasis of Blockchain program is to understand the blockchain like Ethereum and Hyperledger (fabric)
        and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JS on framework like Node.js The program also introduces
        them to development of Distributed Apps (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and in-depth understanding of
        Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial coin offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.
    </p>
    <h2>IoT</h2>
    <p>
        The IoT program introduces the student to open source development technologieslike Rust, Embedded 
        Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant, and Kubernetes while ranking the efficient in developing 
        Microservices for IoT Edge, IOT Cloud, and Voice computing for device control.
