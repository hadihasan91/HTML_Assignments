    <p id="bcc">
        <h1>Blockchain Computing</h1>
        The main emphasis of Blockchain program is to understand the blockchain like Ethereum and Hyperledger (fabric)
        and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JS on framework like Node.js The program also introduces
        them to development of Distributed Apps (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and in-depth understanding of
        Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial coin offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.
